# this is a comment used in python just like pressing on the ctr + / buttons in vannila javascript

# to run this application head to terminal and call the location of the file you want to run first

# eg:for this file i will call python3 lib/app.py

# you can choose how you want the python() to be outputed at the end while using the END parameter

# eg print("welcom to my world!", end="Mungai")

# print("Hello world!", end=" ")

# print("Hello sun!", end="!! ")

# print("Hello sky!", end="!!!\n")

Looping statements use the While - the "while" loops endlessly as seen in the (loop.py)


<!-- HOW TO READ ERRORS IN PYTHON -->
In this example it has 3 stages being the "where" "who" "why"
first the error message in the terminal is this
     File "lib/a_name_error.py",
       line 3, in <module>
        print(hello_world)
      NameError: name 'hello_world' is not defined
<!-- this the output of code in the terminal -->

  2.Showing "where" the error is 
     "lib/a_name_error.py"--is the file the error occurred in.
       line 3 --is the line of code with the error.
            <module> --is the scope of the error.

<!-- 3 COMMON ERRORS TYPES -->
1. Syntax Errors --Syntax errors are pretty self-explanatory: they're the result of incorrect syntax. Thankfully, they're usually followed by a guess about the location of the error. For instance:
     2 * #
   will result in 
   File "<stdin>", line 1
    2 * #
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

2. Logic Errors --
