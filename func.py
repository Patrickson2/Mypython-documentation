# my function display
# the use of the def word shows that the rest of the code is being a function
def greet_programmer():

# greet_programmer = "Hello, programmer!"
greet_programmer()

# on this code i cannot excute because i am overiding the entire code wile still calling line 6
            #  python3 func.py
            #  Traceback (most recent call last):
            #    File "/home/mungai/Documents/moringaProjects/phase3/python-class/func.py", line 7, in <module>
                #  greet_programmer()
            #  TypeError: 'str' object is not callable

# so to go about this i commented on line 6 to remove the overide of the code.
